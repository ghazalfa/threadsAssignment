# Stable Marriages

## Lab Activity

- Implement a method (`Utils.isStable`) that verifies if a given matching is stable or not.

## Exercise

- Implement `run` in `stablemarriages.Girl` to develop a stable matching.
- Look at the given code. Is it thread-safe? Is the use of `synchronized` appropriate or excessive?

## Notes

- This activity emphasizes the use of threads with data sharing.
- You can learn how to read and write JSON format using the provided examples.
- You can learn how to write parameterized tests in JUnit 5 and apply the DRY principle when developing tests.

## Grading

For the lab activity and the exercise, a complete implementation that passes all hidden tests would fetch an **A**. Otherwise, the grade will be an **F**.
